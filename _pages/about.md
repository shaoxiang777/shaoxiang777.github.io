I am a Researcher in the Augmented Reality department at DFKI in Germany, under the supervision of [Alain Pagani](https://sites.google.com/site/alainpagani/) and [Didier Stricker](https://av.dfki.de/members/stricker/). 

I received my Master’s degree in Mechatronics from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), during which I conducted a 6-month thesis project in efficient computer vision at [BMW Group](https://www.bmwgroup.com/en/innovation/automated-driving.html) with Lukas Frickenstein, under the supervision of [Jürgen Becker](https://www.itiv.kit.edu/21_53.php) at KIT and [Walter Stechele](https://www.ce.cit.tum.de/lis/stechele/) at TU Munich. Prior to KIT, I obtained a Bachelor’s degree in Mechatronics from Harbin Institute of Technology.
